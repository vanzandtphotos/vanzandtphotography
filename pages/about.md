Hi! Thank you for stopping by my site and your interest in my photography services.
My name is Sophie and I have developed a deep love for candid photography over the
last few years. When I see a beautiful light, filled with beautiful people (YOU) I am like a
kid in a candy store and want to create/with you. If I could help everyone have
amazing memories of a specific time of theirs lives, documented in a natural and
relaxed environment, I would be in heaven! This is my true passion!
If you or your kiddos doing photo shoots, you can feel comfort in knowing I will take the
time to laugh and play with the kids, make everyone feel as ease and let the scene
unfold as we explore during our time together! Candid members become my most
valued memories to have captured of my own family and friends, and this is what I aim
to create for you!
I look forward to working with you!
